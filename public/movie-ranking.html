<h3>Tron Legacy</h3>
<p>I love the futuristic vibes and the storytelling.</p>

<h3>Iron Giant</h3>
<p>Its always been a childhood favorite, the nostalgia I get from wathcing it is nice.</p>

<h3>Insidious 1</h3>
<p>This movie just gives 
me chills but the story is deffinitely unlike other horror movies and the erie sounds make it that much scarier</p>
